# University Admission Prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers

This repository contains Python code for predicting university admission using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. The code performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), builds and evaluates Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, and compares their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `admission.csv`, which contains information about university applicants including their GRE scores, university ratings, chance of admission, etc.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rohit-27-Patil/University-Admission-Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest-Classifiers.git

cd university-admission-prediction


2. Run the Python script:

python Class  Assessment 5.ipynb


## Contents

- `university_admission_prediction.py`: Python script containing the code for the project.
- `university_admission_data.csv`: Dataset used for prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Results

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tasks performed include visualizing random rows, generating descriptive statistics, checking data shape, and creating correlation matrices.
- Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers are built and evaluated for predicting university admission.
- Model comparison is performed to determine the optimum classifier.
